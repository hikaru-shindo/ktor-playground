# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Sets up the build environment
      - name: Setup Java JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2.3.1
        with:
          # The Java version to set up. Takes a whole or semver Java version. See examples of supported syntax in README file
          java-version: '15'
          # Java distribution. See the list of supported distributions in README file
          distribution: 'adopt'
          # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
          check-latest: true

      # Check if code compiles, run tests, etc ...
      - name: check
        run: ./gradlew clean check
